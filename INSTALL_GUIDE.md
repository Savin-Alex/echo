## üíª Step 5: Download Echo Copilot

### 5.1 Install Git (if you don't have it)

Check if you have Git:
```bash
git --version
```

If you see a version number ‚Üí Skip to 5.2

If not:
- **macOS**: Git is usually included. If not, go to https://git-scm.com/download/mac
- **Windows**: Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win and install

### 5.2 Choose Installation Folder

We'll install Echo in a folder you can easily find.

**On macOS:**
```bash
cd ~/Documents
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents
```

### 5.3 Download Echo

Type this command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Savin-Alex/echo.git
```

You'll see:
```
Cloning into 'echo'...
remote: Counting objects...
Receiving objects: 100% ...
```

When it finishes, type:
```bash
cd echo
```

You're now **inside** the Echo folder!

---

## üîß Step 6: Install Echo's Dependencies

### 6.1 Install Node.js Packages (Frontend)

Type this:
```bash
npm install
```

**What you'll see:**
- Lots of text scrolling by
- Lines like "added 397 packages"
- This takes **2-5 minutes**

**If you see errors about Python or node-gyp:**
- Don't worry! These are optional packages
- As long as it says "added X packages" at the end, you're fine

‚úÖ When it finishes ‚Üí **Frontend installed!**

---

## üêç Step 7: Setup Python Backend

### 7.1 Go to Python Folder

Type:
```bash
cd python-workers
```

### 7.2 Create Python Virtual Environment

A "virtual environment" keeps Echo's Python packages separate from your system.

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

**What happens:**
- Creates a `.venv` folder (you won't see much output)
- Takes 10-30 seconds

### 7.3 Activate Virtual Environment

This tells your terminal to use Echo's Python, not the system one.

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt):**
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```bash
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**How to know it worked:**
- Your terminal prompt will change
- You'll see `(.venv)` at the beginning of the line
- Example: `(.venv) alex@mac python-workers %`

‚úÖ If you see `(.venv)` ‚Üí **Success!**

### 7.4 Install Python Packages

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Make sure you see `(.venv)` in your prompt before running this!

Type:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What happens:**
- Downloads and installs AI libraries
- **This is SLOW** - takes 5-15 minutes depending on internet
- You'll see lots of:
  - "Collecting package-name..."
  - "Downloading package-name..."
  - "Installing package-name..."

**Common things you might see:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow warnings about pip version ‚Üí **Ignore these**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings about dependencies ‚Üí **Usually fine**
- ‚ùå RED errors ‚Üí **Stop and ask for help**

**When finished, you'll see:**
```
Successfully installed fastapi-0.109.0 uvicorn-0.27.0 ... (and many more)
```

‚úÖ **Done!** Python backend is ready.

---

## üéØ Step 8: Build the Application

### 8.1 Go Back to Main Folder

Type:
```bash
cd ..
```

You should now be in the `echo` folder (not `python-workers`).

Verify by typing:
```bash
pwd
```

Should show something ending in `/echo` or `\echo`

### 8.2 Go to Electron Folder

Type:
```bash
cd electron-app
```

### 8.3 Install Electron Dependencies

Type:
```bash
npm install
```

Wait for it to finish (1-2 minutes).

### 8.4 Build the Electron Main Process

This compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript.

Type:
```bash
npm run build:main
```

**What you'll see:**
- Might see some warnings ‚Üí **Ignore them**
- Should finish quickly (5-10 seconds)
- No errors ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Success!**

---

## üöÄ Step 9: Run Echo Copilot!

### 9.1 Go Back to Main Folder

Type:
```bash
cd ..
```

You're now back in the main `echo` folder.

### 9.2 Start Echo

**This is the moment! üéâ**

Type:
```bash
npm run dev
```

**What happens:**
1. Terminal shows lots of output
2. You'll see:
   ```
   [PY] INFO: Started server process
   [PY] INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
   [ELECTRON] Electron app ready
   ```
3. **A window opens** - This is Echo Copilot!

### 9.3 What You Should See

In the Echo window:
- **Title**: "Echo Copilot" at the top
- **Status Badge**: Shows "Connected" with a green dot (‚óè) or "Disconnected" with red (‚óã)
- **Controls**: Start/Stop buttons and language selector
- **Text Area**: Big box where you can type
- **Buttons**: "Summarize" and "Reply"

---

## ‚úÖ Step 10: Test It!

### 10.1 Wait for Green Status

1. Look at the top-right corner
2. Wait until you see **green dot (‚óè) and "Connected"**
3. If it stays red after 30 seconds, see Troubleshooting below

### 10.2 Test Summarization

1. In the text area, type or paste:
```
We had a great meeting today. John suggested we move the deadline to next Friday. 
Sarah agreed and will update the project plan. Mike will review the budget and 
send us his feedback by Wednesday. Everyone was happy with the progress we've made.
```

2. Click the **"Summarize"** button
3. Wait 5-10 seconds
4. Below, you should see bullet points summarizing the text!

Example output:
```
‚Ä¢ Deadline moved to next Friday
‚Ä¢ Sarah to update project plan
